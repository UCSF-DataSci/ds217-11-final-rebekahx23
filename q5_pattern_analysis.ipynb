    "\n",
    "Identify trends over time, analyze seasonal patterns, and create correlation analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Series Note:** Time series data has temporal patterns (trends, seasonality, cycles). Use time-based aggregations and visualizations to identify these patterns. See **Lecture 09** for time series decomposition and pattern analysis. Use pandas `resample()` to aggregate by time periods (e.g., `resample('ME')` for monthly, `resample('D')` for daily) and `groupby()` with temporal features (hour, day_of_week, month) to identify patterns.\n",

    "### 1. `output/q5_correlations.csv`\n",
    "**Format:** CSV file\n",
    "**Content:** Correlation matrix (can be subset of key variables)\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Square matrix with variable names as both index and columns\n",
    "- Values are correlation coefficients (between -1 and 1)\n",
    "- Can be subset of key variables (e.g., top 10 most important variables)\n",
    "- **Include index/column names** when saving: `corr_matrix.to_csv('output/q5_correlations.csv')`\n",

    "**Example format:**\n",

    "**Required visualizations (at least 2 of these):**\n",
    "1. **Trend over time:** Line plot showing variable(s) over time (e.g., monthly averages)\n",
    "2. **Seasonal pattern:** Bar plot or line plot showing patterns by month, day of week, or hour\n",
    "3. **Correlation heatmap:** Heatmap of correlation matrix\n",
    "4. **Multi-panel plot:** Multiple subplots showing different patterns\n",

    "- Clear axis labels (xlabel, ylabel)\n",
    "- Title for each subplot\n",
    "- Overall figure title (optional but recommended)\n",
    "- Legend if multiple series shown\n",
    "- Saved as PNG with sufficient resolution (dpi=150 or higher)\n",

    "## Your Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify trends** - Use `.resample()` to aggregate by time period and visualize long-term patterns\n",
    "2. **Analyze seasonal patterns** - Use `.groupby()` with temporal features (hour, day_of_week, month)\n",
    "3. **Create correlation analysis** - Compute correlation matrix for numeric columns\n",
    "4. **Create visualizations** - Multi-panel plot showing trends, seasonal patterns, and correlations\n",
    "5. **Document patterns** - Summarize key findings in text file\n",

    "## Decision Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trend identification:** Is there a long-term trend? Is it increasing, decreasing, or stable? Use time series plots to visualize.\n",
    "- **Seasonal patterns:** Are there daily patterns? Weekly? Monthly? Use aggregations and visualizations to identify.\n",
    "- **Correlation analysis:** Which variables are correlated? Use correlation matrix and heatmaps. Focus on relationships that might be useful for modeling.\n",
